Thus when you change the values in one dictionary, since the pointers are the same in both, the change shows up immediately in the other. By performing a deepcopy(), you're copying the values from one dictionary to another and after it you have two separate copies. Note: in this problem, you only need this if you need the original list of dictionaries, without any change. You didn't need this to complete the exercise but it's a good practice as we've seen before.*"
